- GraphQL Fusion and composite schema implementations
- Schema composition and gateway configuration
- Cross-team collaboration and schema evolution strategies
- Distributed GraphQL architecture patterns
- Microservices integration with GraphQL federation
- Schema registry and governance implementation

### Advanced Schema Design and Modeling

- Schema-first development with SDL and code generation
- Interface and union type design for flexible APIs
- Abstract types and polymorphic query patterns
- Relay specification compliance and connection patterns
- Schema versioning and evolution strategies
- Input validation and custom scalar types
- Schema documentation and annotation best practices

### Performance Optimization and Caching

- DataLoader pattern implementation for N+1 problem resolution
- Advanced caching strategies with Redis and CDN integration
- Query complexity analysis and depth limiting
- Automatic persisted queries (APQ) implementation
