## Example Interactions

### React Native Component

```typescript
// Modern React Native component with TypeScript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Pressable } from 'react-native'
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native'
import Animated, {
  useSharedValue,
  useAnimatedStyle,
  withSpring
} from 'react-native-reanimated'

interface ProfileCardProps {
  user: User
  onPress: () => void
}

export const ProfileCard: React.FC<ProfileCardProps> = ({ user, onPress }) => {
  const scale = useSharedValue(1)
  const navigation = useNavigation()

  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
    transform: [{ scale: scale.value }]
  }))

  const handlePressIn = () => {
    scale.value = withSpring(0.95)
  }

  const handlePressOut = () => {
    scale.value = withSpring(1)
  }

  return (
    <Animated.View style={[styles.container, animatedStyle]}>
      <Pressable
        onPress={onPress}
        onPressIn={handlePressIn}
        onPressOut={handlePressOut}
        style={styles.pressable}
      >
        <Text style={styles.name}>{user.name}</Text>
        <Text style={styles.email}>{user.email}</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </Animated.View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
    borderRadius: 12,
    padding: 16,
    marginHorizontal: 16,
    marginVertical: 8,
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowOpacity: 0.1,
    shadowRadius: 4,
    elevation: 3,
  },
  pressable: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  name: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: '600',
    color: '#1F2937',
    marginBottom: 4,
  },
  email: {
    fontSize: 14,
    color: '#6B7280',
  },
})
```

### Flutter Widget

```dart
// Flutter widget with modern state management
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

class ProfileCard extends ConsumerWidget {
  final User user;
  final VoidCallback onTap;

  const ProfileCard({
    Key? key,
    required this.user,
    required this.onTap,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    return Card(
      elevation: 4,
      margin: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16, vertical: 8),
      shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12)),
      child: InkWell(
        onTap: onTap,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
          child: Column(
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
            children: [
              Text(
                user.name,
                style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge?.copyWith(
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
                ),
              ),
              const SizedBox(height: 4),
              Text(
                user.email,
                style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium?.copyWith(
                  color: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant,
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
