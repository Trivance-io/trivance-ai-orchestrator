# Playwright MCP Test Generator – Autonomous AI Testing

## Mission

Generate comprehensive E2E tests through AI-powered autonomous exploration using Playwright MCP. Like a human tester, discover application functionality dynamically and create tests based on real behavior observation.

**Natural Language Input**:
Simply describe what you want to test in plain English:

- "Test the login functionality"
- "Generate tests for the contact form"
- "Create comprehensive tests for the dashboard"
- "Test all authentication flows"

**TARGET URL**: The only required parameter is the application URL to explore

## Executable Workflow Process

You are a senior test engineer executing a precise 6-phase process to generate, validate, and report Playwright tests. Follow each step exactly as specified below.

## PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT SETUP & VALIDATION

### Step 1.1: Verify Playwright Installation

● **Action**: Execute `npx playwright --version`
◆ **Success Criteria**: Version number displayed (e.g., "Version 1.40.0")
◆ **Failure Action**: Execute `npm install @playwright/test && npx playwright install`
◆ **Validation**: Re-run version check - must succeed to proceed

### Step 1.2: Port Conflict Resolution

● **Action**: Check ports sequentially: `lsof -i :3000`, `lsof -i :5173`, `lsof -i :8080`, `lsof -i :9323`
◆ **If conflicts found**: Execute `pkill -f [process_name]` for each conflicting process
◆ **Validation**: Re-check all ports are free before proceeding

### Step 1.3: MCP Browser Verification & Target URL Accessibility

● **Action**: Verify MCP Playwright tools are available and functional
● **Action**: Use `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to navigate to `[target_url]`
◆ **Success Criteria**: Navigation succeeds and page snapshot is captured
◆ **Timeout**: 30 seconds maximum
◆ **Failure Action**: Report inaccessible target or MCP tools unavailable and stop process
▶ **Output**: Initial page snapshot for UI mapping

### Step 1.4: Test Infrastructure Setup

● **Action**: Check if `tests/e2e/` directory exists using `ls tests/e2e/`
◆ **If missing**: Create with `mkdir -p tests/e2e/pages tests/e2e/specs tests/e2e/utils`
● **Action**: Check if `playwright.config.js` exists
◆ **If missing**: Generate basic config with target URL, browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit), html+json reporters
▶ **Output**: Complete test directory structure ready

## PHASE 2: AUTONOMOUS EXPLORATION & DISCOVERY

### Step 2.1: Natural Language Task Interpretation

● **Action**: Parse user's natural language instruction to identify testing intent
● **Examples**:

- "Test the login" → Focus on authentication flows
- "Test contact form" → Focus on form workflows
- "Test everything" → Comprehensive exploration
  ● **Strategy**: Start exploration from target URL without assumptions about structure
  ▶ **Output**: Clear exploration strategy based on user intent

### Step 2.2: Autonomous Application Discovery

● **Action**: Like a human user, systematically explore the application:

**Initial Navigation Discovery:**
● **Action**: Use `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` to understand landing page structure
● **Action**: Identify all clickable navigation elements using snapshot analysis
● **Action**: Use `mcp__playwright__browser_click` to explore each navigation path autonomously

**Feature Discovery Through Interaction:**
● **Action**: For each discovered page/section, take fresh snapshots to understand functionality
● **Action**: Autonomously interact with forms, buttons, and controls to understand behavior
● **Action**: Document actual user flows by following realistic usage patterns
● **Action**: Use `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot` at key discovery moments

**Network & API Discovery:**
● **Action**: Use `mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests` to capture all API calls during exploration
● **Action**: Monitor network activity to discover:

- REST API endpoints and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Authentication endpoints and token handling
- Form submission endpoints and payload structures
- Error response patterns and status codes
- Rate limiting and security headers
  ● **Action**: Use `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` to collect:
- JavaScript errors and warnings during interactions
- Performance metrics and timing data
- Custom application logging and debug messages
- Resource loading failures and network errors
  ● **Action**: Establish performance baselines using `mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate` to measure:
- Page load times and resource timing
- JavaScript execution performance
- Memory usage patterns
- Network latency and request timing
  ▶ **Output**: Complete API endpoint mapping, error patterns, and performance baselines

**Dynamic Learning:**
● **Action**: Build understanding of application structure through real interaction
● **Action**: Identify authentication requirements, form workflows, navigation patterns
● **Action**: Discover edge cases and error conditions through exploratory testing
▶ **Output**: Comprehensive understanding of application functionality discovered through real usage

### Step 2.3: Existing Test Pattern Analysis

● **Action**: Check for existing tests: `find . -name "*test*" -o -name "*spec*" | head -10`
● **Action**: If tests exist, read 2-3 examples to understand patterns
◆ **Apply patterns**: Use same naming, structure, and helper patterns if found
▶ **Output**: Test structure and naming conventions to follow

## PHASE 3: DYNAMIC TEST GENERATION FROM DISCOVERIES

### Step 3.1: Real-Time Test Generation Based on Exploration

● **Action**: For each discovered user flow, generate test code immediately based on MCP exploration
● **No Page Objects**: Generate tests directly using role-based and reference-based selectors discovered through MCP
● **Live Validation**: Test each generated interaction using MCP tools before proceeding to next test
● **Dynamic Selectors**: Extract role-based selectors from MCP accessibility snapshots using this process:

- Parse snapshot YAML structure to identify interactive elements
- Extract role, name, and accessibility properties from each element
- Generate getByRole() selectors using discovered names and roles
- Fallback to getByText() for elements without clear roles
- Use ref attributes only as last resort for complex interactions

**Example Generation Pattern:**

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("should complete login flow discovered through exploration", async ({
  page,
}) => {
  // Navigate to discovered login page
  await page.goto("${discovered_login_url}");

  // Use role-based selectors extracted from MCP accessibility snapshots
  await page
    .getByRole("textbox", { name: "${discovered_email_label}" })
    .fill("admin@test.com");
  await page
    .getByRole("textbox", { name: "${discovered_password_label}" })
    .fill("admin123");
  await page.getByRole("button", { name: "${discovered_submit_text}" }).click();

  // Multiple assertion points based on discovered success indicators
  await expect(page.getByText("${discovered_success_message}")).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/dashboard|home/);
  await expect(page.getByRole("${discovered_user_indicator}")).toContainText(
    "${user_name}",
  );
});
