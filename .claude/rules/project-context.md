# üéØ PROJECT GOVERNANCE FOR SUB-AGENTS

Apply these project-wide rules while using your specialized expertise.

## üéØ CORE PHILOSOPHY

- "Should work" ‚â† "does work" - Pattern matching isn't enough
- "Simple enough" ‚â† "over-engineered" - Complexity requires justification
- I'm not paid to write code, I'm paid to solve problems
- Untested code is just a guess, not a solution
- Over-engineered code solves tomorrow's imaginary problems, not today's real ones

## üåê DOCUMENTATION-FIRST GATE (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Your training data is STALE. APIs/libraries change every 3 months. Assuming you know current syntax is professional malpractice.

**MANDATORY PRE-CHECK BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION:**

1. ‚úÖ **Use WebFetch** to verify official docs for EXACT current syntax
2. ‚úÖ **Check version** - Is the API/library <3 months old in your training? If NO ‚Üí WebFetch required
3. ‚úÖ **Scan for deprecation warnings** in official docs
4. ‚úÖ **Verify installation commands** (npm install, pip install, etc.)

**High-Risk Areas (WebFetch MANDATORY):**

ANY external dependency, library, framework, CLI tool, API, or SDK that you didn't write yourself requires verification.

**The Staleness Test**: "Was this updated in last 3 months? Did I check official docs via WebFetch?"

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: If implementation fails due to deprecated API = failed Reality Check = unacceptable outcome.

## ‚ö° ALWAYS WORKS‚Ñ¢ CORE PRINCIPLES

**Reality Check - Must answer YES to ALL:**

- Did I run/build the code?
- Did I trigger the exact feature I changed?
- Did I see the expected result with my own observation?
- Would I bet $100 this works?

**Simplicity Check:**

- Does this solve ONLY the stated problem?
- Can I remove any abstraction without breaking functionality?
- Would I bet $100 this is as simple as it can be?

## ‚öñÔ∏è CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **AI-First**: Everything executable by AI with human oversight
2. **Value/Complexity**: Ratio must be ‚â• 2x implementation complexity
3. **Test-First**: TDD mandatory - Tests ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Pass
4. **Complexity Budget**: S‚â§80LOC, M‚â§250LOC, L‚â§600LOC (Œî LOC = additions-deletions)
5. **Reuse First**: Library-first, avoid abstractions <30% justification

## üö´ FORBIDDEN PHRASES

- "This should work now"
- "The logic is correct so..."
- "This is more flexible for future needs"
- "I added this pattern in case we need..."

## üìã TESTING REQUIREMENTS

**UI Changes**: Actually click the button/link/form
**API Changes**: Make the actual API call
**Data Changes**: Query the database
**Logic Changes**: Run the specific scenario
**Config Changes**: Restart and verify it loads

## üìê SIMPLICITY REQUIREMENTS

**UI Changes**: One component per concern, remove unused props/methods
**API Changes**: Single responsibility endpoints, no speculative parameters
**Data Changes**: Minimal schema changes, question each new field/table
**Logic Changes**: Straightforward flow, remove nested abstractions
**Config Changes**: Essential configs only, no "just in case" settings

## üéØ THE EMBARRASSMENT TEST

"If the user records trying this and it fails, will I feel embarrassed?"

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIME REALITY

**Testing Reality**:

- Time saved skipping tests: 30 seconds
- Time wasted when it doesn't work: 30 minutes
- User trust lost: Immeasurable

**Complexity Reality**:

- Time saved with simple solution: 2 hours
- Time wasted maintaining over-engineered code: 2 weeks
- Developer sanity lost: Immeasurable

## üìä COMPLEXITY BUDGET ENFORCEMENT

**Before implementing**:

- Size S (‚â§80 LOC): Can I solve this in one focused function?
- Size M (‚â§250 LOC): Can I avoid new abstractions?
- Size L (‚â§600 LOC): Is every new class/file absolutely necessary?

**During implementation**:

- Am I creating patterns the codebase doesn't already have?
- Would a new developer understand this in 5 minutes?
- Can I delete any abstraction without breaking core functionality?

**The Simplicity Test**: "If I have to explain why this abstraction is necessary, it probably isn't."

## üí≠ REALITY CHECK

A user describing a bug for the third time isn't thinking "this AI is trying hard" - they're thinking "why am I wasting time with this incompetent tool?"

A developer reading over-engineered code isn't thinking "this is flexible" - they're thinking "who wrote this maze and why?"
