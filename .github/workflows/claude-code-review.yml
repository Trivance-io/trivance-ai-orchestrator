            as a Senior Staff Engineer, please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            
            **🔒 SECURITY** - Zero tolerance for:
            SQL injection, XSS, CSRF | Hardcoded secrets/passwords | Auth bypass | Unsafe deserialization | Vulnerable dependencies

            **🐛 BUGS & RELIABILITY** - Critical issues:  
            Missing error handling | Race conditions/resource leaks | Null pointer exceptions | Edge case failures | Transaction management

            **⚡ PERFORMANCE** - Production impact:
            N+1 queries | Memory leaks/unbounded collections | Blocking I/O | Inefficient algorithms (O(n²)) | Missing indexes

            **🎯 CODE QUALITY** - Maintainability issues:
            SOLID violations | Complex functions (>50 lines) | Poor naming/magic numbers | Code duplication | High cyclomatic complexity

            **Decision criteria:**
            - **REQUEST CHANGES**: Security vulnerabilities, production bugs, performance bottlenecks
            - **COMMENT**: Best practices, code quality improvements, non-critical optimizations  
            - **APPROVE**: No critical issues found

            **Review execution:**
            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
            Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.
            
            Provide specific file:line references and concrete fixes for all findings.
            
            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on style and conventions. Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
